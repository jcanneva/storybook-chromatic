# Welcome to Storybook

Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

Browse example stories now by navigating to them in the sidebar.
View their code in the `stories` directory to learn how they work.
We recommend building UIs with a [**component-driven**](https://componentdriven.org) process starting with atomic components and ending with pages.

## Quick start

1.  **Create the application.**

    Use [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) to get this template.

    ```shell
    # Clone the template
    npx degit jcanneva/storybook-chromatic
    ```

2.  **Install the dependencies.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and install the necessary dependencies.

    ```shell

    # Navigate to the root directory and install the dependencies
    yarn
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Open the root directory in your code editor and build a component

4.  **Browse your stories!**

    Run `yarn storybook` to see your component's stories at `http://localhost:6006`
